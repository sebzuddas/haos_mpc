# Intended Use
To be able to effectively interact with HAOS via Python scripts for advanced automation procedures. Although .yaml files can be used to create useful automations, it may be that more advanced automations should be developed, and for the processing to occur outside of HAOS. This set of scripts is intended to make the interplay between HAOS and some other techniques easier.
